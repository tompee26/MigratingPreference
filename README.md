# Arctic Tern
A local persistence framework backed by SharedPreferences with simple migration and Flow support.

![example workflow](https://github.com/tompee26/arctic-tern/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

## Features
- Generates implementation code for your preference files.
- Generates a manager class that allows you to create the implementations.
- TODO: Migration support

## Getting started
Note: `ksp` is needed to process annotations

In your project's `build.gradle.kts`, under buildscript, add the `ksp` plugin to the classpath

```
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath(com.google.devtools.ksp:com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.plugin:<ksp-version>)
    }
}
```

In your app's `build.gradle.kts` add the `ksp` plugin and the `ArcticTern` dependencies. Also, manually add the kotlin generated path into the source sets.

```
plugins {
    ...
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp")
}

kotlin {
    sourceSets.debug {
        kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/debug/kotlin")
    }
    sourceSets.release {
        kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/release/kotlin")
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.tompee26:arctic-tern-nest:$latest_version")
    implementation("io.github.tompee26:arctic-tern-annotation:$latest_version")
    ksp("io.github.tompee26:arctic-tern-compiler:$latest_version")
}
```

## How to use it / How it works

### Application

Annotate your application class with `@ArcticTernApp`. This is so a manager class can be created in the same package. The manager will be responsible for providing
instances of the autogenerated preference classes. The manager instance will be a singleton but the instances of the autogenerated classes are not, so it is your responsibility to scope them manually or using a DI service.

```
@ArcticTernApp
class MyApplication : Application()
```

### Arctic Tern File

Create an `abstract class` that will be used to store your preference and annotate it with `@ArcticTern`. The `name` is optional and if not provided will default to `ArcticTern<class-name>`, the `preferenceFile` is the filename of the backing `SharedPreferences` file and the `version` of the file.


```
@ArcticTern(name = "ActualPreference", filename = "pref_sample", version = 1)
abstract class MyAbstractPreference
```

At this point, a class will be generated depending on the `name` property. And the manager will generate 2 factory methods, 1 using your abstract class name and 1 using the actual class name, for you to use interchangeably, depending on your preference.

```
class ArcticTernFactory {
    ....
    fun createMyAbstractPreference() : ActualPreference = ....
    fun createActualPreference() : ActualPreference = ....
}
```

### Property

Properties are defined inside the `@ArcticTern` file. They will be used as getters and setters for your data. Below are the rules regarding property definition
1. Properties must be `open` - this is so the implementation class can override it
2. Properties must be declared `var` (or mutable) - for you to be able to get/set values
3. Properties must be assigned with a default value - to calculate default values when not yet set
4. Property types must be a supported type - supported types are declared below

```
@ArcticTern(name = "ActualPreference", filename = "pref_sample", version = 1)
abstract class MyAbstractPreference {

    @ArcticTern.Property
    open var counter : Long = 0L
}
```

Property can be configured further. Supply `key` if you want to use a different `SharedPreferences` key, `withFlow` to true, if you want to generate a function that exposes a `Flow` for you to observe state changes, and `withDelete` to true to generate a function that allows you to delete the property's value.

Note: All custom generated functions are available only in the implementation class.

### ObjectProperty

Similar to `Property` but this allows for custom object persistence. A `Serializer` implementation is required in the annotation.

```
data class IntWrapper(val intData: Int) {

    class IntWrapperSerializer : Serializer<IntWrapper> {

        override fun serialize(input: IntWrapper): String {
            return input.intData.toString()
        }

        override fun deserialize(serializedString: String): IntWrapper {
            return IntWrapper(Integer.parseInt(serializedString))
        }
    }
```

```
@ArcticTern.ObjectProperty(IntWrapperSerializer::class)
open var counter : IntWrapper = IntWrapper(0)
```

### NullableObjectProperty (TODO)

## Supported Types

| Type          | Nullable    |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Int           | No          |
| Boolean       | No          |
| Float         | No          |
| Long          | No          |
| String        | Yes         |
| Set\<String\> | Yes         |
| Set<String?>  | Yes         |
